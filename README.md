# University of Ume√• - AI assignments
Repository for two AI assignments and a web crawler to parse student mail addresses from a Moodle-like platform.
The first AI assignment is the implementation of a path-tracking algorithm (pure pursuit) of a Roomba-like robot. 
It is enriched with a simple object detection with a laser scan (optimizes the given path until it would encounter an obstacle).
This assignment is located in ai-fundamentals/assign1-robot.

The second assignment is the implementation of the perceptron learning algorithm to classify the emotion of noisy smiley faces. Some image processing was also used 
to improve the precision (rotation using eyebrow detection and blur). This assignment is located in ai-fundamentals/assign2-neural. 

The assignments of the advanced AI course are in their own repository, umu-othello and umu-ai-mapmaker.
